## 👋 Hello! I'm João Augusto

🎓 **Computer Science undergraduate** at the Federal University of Maranhão  
🔧 **Researcher** in mathematical modeling and simulation  
📍 São Luís - MA, Brazil

I'm passionate about applying computational tools to real-world problems. I specialize in optimization, simulation, and software development for logistics and transportation systems — from port operations to public transit. I'm currently studying how **Artificial Intelligence** can support **Operations Research and Decision-Making**.
